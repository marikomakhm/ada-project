# Who's the biggest tax evader?

Motivation:

- is it only Panama?
- who was involved? How are they connected?
- what are the (socioeconomic factors) links between these countries?

## Introduction

(add catchy intro sentence)

Panama Papers are 11.5 million documents taken from Panamian law firm Mossack Fonseca, and leaked by an anonymous source in 2015. The impact of this leak has been tremendous, revealing information about 143 politicians, twelve of which are national leaders, and their use of tax havens for money laundering and tax evasion.

Switzerland has a strong reputation as a tax haven for many rich Russian and British people of power. The British Virgin Islands has one of the highest incomes per capita with an opaque banking system. We want to confirm our assumptions about these countries, and study how different countries are interconnected in the scandal. How involved is Panama, the center of the scandal, in Panama Papers? Which country is the biggest tax haven? Most of all, are we able to find patterns between the countries involved in the scandal? Do countries with higher GDPs tend to be more dishonest? So many questions. Let's start at the beginning.

## What's in the Panama Papers?

We had a total of five Panama Papers datasets at our disposition. These datasets represent a graph, with three datasets containing three types of nodes, as well as a dataset containing edges linking the nodes. The nodes are people and organizations involved in the Panama Papers. The fifth dataset contains the addresses of these peopleand organizations. Here's a breakdown on the three types of nodes we have:

- **Entities:** offshore entities are companies, trusts or funds created by agents in low-tax jurisdictions that typically attract non-resident clients through preferential tax treatment. Agents are firms in offshore jurisdictions that manage offshore entities at their clients' request.
- **Officers:** officers are people or companies that play some role in an offshore entity. These are typically shareholders and beneficiaries of the offshore companies.
- **Intermediaries:** intermediaries are the lawyers and service providers who helped set up offshore entities.

  - Say what the dataset sources are
- Describing fun things about it
  - How many addresses in total
  - How many entities in total
  - How many officers in total
  - How many intermediaries in total
