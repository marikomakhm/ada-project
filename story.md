# Who's the biggest tax evader?

Motivation:

- is it only Panama?
- who was involved? How are they connected?
- what are the (socioeconomic factors) links between these countries?

## Introduction

(add catchy intro sentence)

Panama Papers are 11.5 million documents taken from Panamian law firm Mossack Fonseca, and leaked by an anonymous source in 2015. The impact of this leak has been tremendous, revealing information about 143 politicians, twelve of which are national leaders, and their use of tax havens for money laundering and tax evasion.

Switzerland has a strong reputation as a tax haven for many rich Russian and British people of power. The British Virgin Islands has one of the highest incomes per capita with an opaque banking system. We want to confirm our assumptions about these countries, and study how different countries are interconnected in the scandal. How involved is Panama, the center of the scandal, in Panama Papers? Which country is the biggest tax haven? Most of all, are we able to find patterns between the countries involved in the scandal? Do countries with higher GDPs tend to be more dishonest? So many questions. Let's start at the beginning.
